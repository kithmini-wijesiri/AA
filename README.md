Use of ML and molecular docking methods to predict the binding energy of a protein-ligand complex.
Here we use **DeepChem** which enables docking with automation and easy integration with machine learning pipelines

I have also used the structure of the **AtomicConvModel** and write a simple program to run Atomic Convolutional Neural Networks.

**ACNN Architecture**
ACNNâ€™s directly exploit the local three-dimensional structure of molecules to hierarchically learn more complex chemical features by optimizing both the model and featurization simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion.
