In this project I have performed Data Collection and Pre-Processing from the ChEMBL Database to find information related to the coronavirus within the specified targets, an exploratory data analysis, descriptor calculation, model building, model comparison and model deployment,to build a bioinformatics project for drug discovery.

We will be collecting bioactivvity data from the ChemBL database, data will be pre-processed dropping the missing data and duplicate data, and the data will be labeled according to their bioactivity thresholds. Then a data analysis will be performed where I clean the dataset to verify the SMILES notation are clean and then I will calculate the descriptors. Then a random forest model will be implemented to perform prediction on quantitative data , and finally deploying the model by converting it into a web app .
